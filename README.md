Analysed Hotel booking data with Python Pandas


💻 Hotel Reservation Analysis

This project analyzes hotel reservation data to gain insights into customer behavior and booking patterns.

📊 Data Analysis

The data was analyzed using Python programming language and various libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Visualizations such as line graphs, bar graphs, and grouped bar graphs were used to represent the data in a clear and concise manner.

👥 Customer Behavior

The analysis revealed that the majority of hotel reservations are made by individuals rather than groups. Additionally, online travel agencies are the primary booking source for customers.

💰 Cancellation Rates

Cancellation rates were found to be higher for bookings made at higher prices. To prevent cancellations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and offer discounts to customers.

🏨 Hotel Types

The analysis also compared the booking patterns of resort hotels and city hotels. The cancellation rate was found to be higher for resort hotels, particularly on weekends and holidays.

🗓️ Booking Patterns

August was found to be the month with the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations. On the other hand, January had the highest number of cancellations.

👉 Recommendations

Based on the analysis, hotels could focus on improving the quality of their services in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate. Additionally, offering discounts on room prices on weekends and holidays could be an effective strategy to reduce cancellation rates.

📈 Conclusion

By analyzing hotel reservation data, valuable insights were gained into customer behavior and booking patterns. These insights can be used by hotels to improve their services, optimize pricing strategies, and reduce cancellation rates.
